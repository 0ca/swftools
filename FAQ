1.) What's the cost of swftools?

    SWFTools is free of charge, and is released under the GPL
    (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

2.) How to compile/link swftools?

    Download swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz and t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz.

    gzip -d swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz
    gzip -d t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz
    tar -xf t1lib-1.3.1.tar
    cd t1lib-1.3.1
    ./configure
    make 
    make install
    cd ..
    tar -xf swftools-0.4.2.tar
    cd swftools-0.4.2
    ./configure
    make 
    make install

3.) Is there a pdf2swf for Windows?

    No. pdf2swf only runs on Unix platforms, like Linux, *BSD, MacOS X, etc.
    There have been some reports on more or less successfully compling pdf2swf on Win32 using
    Cygwin (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin), however, there's no working version
    yet.
    If you want to use pdf2swf, find a Unix machine.

4.) Is there *going to* be a pdf2swf for Windows?

    Probably. As soon as we find the time to look into the Cygwin compile issues.

5.) Can png2swf handle transparency?

    It supports PNG mode 2 transparency (alpha palettes) since version 0.4.2. 
    Mode 6 (32 bit RGBA truecolor) is also supported since version 0.4.3, however
    it seems most Flash players don't handle the alpha channel in the resulting 
    32 bit images correctly.

6.) How to get Flash MX compression with SWFTools?

    Most tools support the -z flag for outputting compressed SWF.
    Furthermore you can compress/uncompress SWF files using swfcombine:

	swfcombine -dz file.swf -o file_new.swf

    compresses, while

	swfcombine -d file.swf -o file_new.swf

    decompresses.

7.) avi2swf converts my avi files upside down!

    Try using the -p (--flip) switch.

8.) How to extract images/sounds from myfile.swf using swfextract?

    First list all extractable items:

	swfextract myfile.swf
    
    The result is something like:

	Objects in file myfile.swf:
	Shapes: 1, 2, 3
	MovieClips: 4, 5, 8, 10, 12
	JPEGs: 69, 116, 447
	PNGs: 318
	Sounds: 28, 29, 30
	Frames: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

    Not you can extract a shape using

	swfextract -i 2 myfile.swf -o shape.swf

    a sound using
	
	swfextract -s 28 myfile.swf -o sound.wav

    a PNG image file using
	
	swfextract -p 318 myfile.swf -o file.png

    etc.

9.) Is there a mailing list for SWFTools?

    There used to be, however it was shut down due to lack of traffic. The archive
    is available as raw INBOX file on http://www.quiss.org/swftools/list.tar.gz.
