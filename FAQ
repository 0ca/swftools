1.) What's the cost of swftools?

    SWFTools is free of charge, and is released under the GPL
    (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

2.) How to compile/link swftools?

    Download swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz and t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz.

    gzip -d swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz
    gzip -d t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz
    tar -xf t1lib-1.3.1.tar
    cd t1lib-1.3.1

    cd ..
    tar -xf swftools-0.4.2.tar
    cd swftools-0.4.2
    ./configure

3.) Is there a pdf2swf for Windows?

    No. pdf2swf only runs on Unix platforms, like Linux, *BSD, MacOS X, etc.
    There have been some successes reported on compling pdf2swf on Win32 using
    Cygwin (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin), however, there's no working version
    yet.
    If you want to use pdf2swf, find a Unix machine.

4.) Is there *going to* be a pdf2swf for Windows?

    Probably. As soon as we find the time to look into the Cygwin compile issues.

5.) Can png2swf handle transparency?

    Yes.

6.) How to get Flash MX compression with SWFTools?

    Most tools support the -z flag for outputting compressed SWF.
    Furthermore you can compress/uncompress SWF files using swfcombine:

    swfcombine -dz file.swf -o file_new.swf

    compresses, while

    swfcombine -d file.swf -o file_new.swf

    decompresses.

7.) Is there a mailing list for SWFTools?

    There used to be, however it was shut down due to lack of traffic. The archive
    is available as raw INBOX file on http://www.quiss.org/swftools/list.tar.gz.

8.) avi2swf converts my avi files upside down!

    Try using the -p (--flip) switch.
