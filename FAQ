1.) What's the cost of swftools?

    SWFTools is free of charge, and is released under the GPL
    (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

2.) How to compile/link swftools?

    Download swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz and t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz.

    gzip -d swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz
    gzip -d t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz
    tar -xf t1lib-1.3.1.tar
    cd t1lib-1.3.1
    ./configure
    make 
    make install
    cd ..
    tar -xf swftools-0.4.2.tar
    cd swftools-0.4.2
    ./configure
    make 
    make install

3.) configure doesn't find my jpeglib / my t1lib!

    In case some of your libraries/include files are installed in /usr/local,
    try the following:

    rm -f config.cache
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" ./configure

    Furthermore, a new installation of jpeglib (the following assumes it's in
    /usr/local/lib) often requires doing a

    ranlib /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.a
    ldconfig /usr/local/lib

    If it still doesn't work, try removing the file "config.cache"
    before running configure again.

4.) Is there a pdf2swf for Windows?

    No. pdf2swf only runs on Unix platforms, like Linux, *BSD, MacOS X, etc.
    There have been some reports on more or less successfully compling pdf2swf on Win32 using
    Cygwin (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin), however, there's no working version yet.

    If you want to use pdf2swf, find a Unix machine.

5.) Is there *going to* be a pdf2swf for Windows?

    Probably. As soon as we find the time to look into the Cygwin compile issues.

6.) The fonts in the SWFs generated by pdf2swf are wrong!

    Try running pdf2swf with the "-v" switch.
    If you see a line reading "substituting VerySpecialFont -> Times-Roman", then pdf2swf
    didn't find some fonts, which may be external references in the pdf. 
    To fix this, copy the fonts into your current directory and pass the "-F ./" (--fontpath ./) 
    option to pdf2swf. (This doesn't yet work with TTF, only with Type1 Fonts. You can 
    convert TTF to Type1, however, using ttf2pt1 (http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net)).
    The font files should, in this case, have the filenames VerySpecialFont.afm and
    VerySpecialFont.pfa (.pfb).

7.) Can png2swf handle transparency?

    It supports PNG mode 2 transparency (256 color palettes with alpha) since version 0.4.2. 
    Mode 6 (32 bit RGBA truecolor) is also supported since version 0.4.4.

8.) How to do Flash MX compression with SWFTools?

    Most tools support the -z flag for outputting compressed SWF.
    Furthermore you can compress/uncompress SWF files using swfcombine:

	swfcombine -dz file.swf -o file_new.swf

    compresses, while

	swfcombine -d file.swf -o file_new.swf

    decompresses.

9.) avi2swf converts my avi files upside down!

    Try using the -p (--flip) switch.

10.) How to extract images/sounds from myfile.swf using swfextract?

    First list all extractable items:

	swfextract myfile.swf
    
    The result is something like:

	Objects in file myfile.swf:
	Shapes: 1, 2, 3
	MovieClips: 4, 5, 8, 10, 12
	JPEGs: 69, 116, 447
	PNGs: 318
	Sounds: 28, 29, 30
	Frames: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

    Not you can extract a shape using

	swfextract -i 2 myfile.swf -o shape.swf

    a sound using
	
	swfextract -s 28 myfile.swf -o sound.wav

    a PNG image file using
	
	swfextract -p 318 myfile.swf -o file.png

    etc.

11.) Is there a mailing list for SWFTools?

    Yes there is. You can subscribe by going to
