1.) What's the cost of swftools?

    SWFTools is free of charge, and is released under the GPL
    (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

2.) How to compile/link swftools?

    Download swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz and t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz.

    gzip -d swftools-0.4.2.tar.gz
    gzip -d t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz
    tar -xf t1lib-1.3.1.tar
    cd t1lib-1.3.1
    ./configure
    make 
    make install
    cd ..
    tar -xf swftools-0.4.2.tar
    cd swftools-0.4.2
    ./configure
    make 
    make install

3.) What libraries do I need to compile swftools?

    You need t1lib and jpeglib to compile pdf2swf.
    Links:
	t1lib: 
	 ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/linux/libs/graphics/t1lib-1.3.1.tar.gz
	t1lib (mirrored here): 
	 http://www.quiss.org/swftools/t1llib-1.3.1.tar.gz
	jpeglib: 
	 http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

    Furthermore, if you want to compile avi2swf, you need the avifile library:
        http://avifile.sourceforge.net
    .

4.) configure doesn't find my jpeglib / my t1lib!

    In case some of your libraries/include files are installed in /usr/local,
    try the following:

    rm -f config.cache
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" ./configure

    Furthermore, a new installation of jpeglib (the following assumes it's in
    /usr/local/lib) often requires doing a

    ranlib /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.a
    ldconfig /usr/local/lib

    If it still doesn't work, try removing the file "config.cache"
    before running configure again.

5.) There are problems during compilation:
    Error messages complain about "undefined reference to `operator new(unsigned)'"
    as well as "undefined reference to `__gxx_personality_v0'".

    Try running configure as

    LDFLAGS=-lstdc++ ./configure

6.) Is there a pdf2swf for Windows?

    Windows versions of all SWF utilities (except for avi2swf) are in
	http://www.quiss.org/swftools/swftools-win32.zip
    .
    Notice: You need to unzip the Archive to C:\SWFTOOLS to make pdf2swf work-
    otherwise it won't be able to find it's fonts.

7.) The fonts in the SWFs generated by pdf2swf are wrong!

    Try running pdf2swf with the "-v" switch.
    If you see a line reading "substituting VerySpecialFont -> Times-Roman", then pdf2swf
    didn't find some fonts, which may be external references in the pdf. 
    To fix this, copy the fonts into your current directory and pass the "-F ./" (--fontpath ./) 
    option to pdf2swf. (This doesn't yet work with TTF, only with Type1 Fonts. You can 
    convert TTF to Type1, however, using ttf2pt1 (http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net)).
    The font files should, in this case, have the filenames VerySpecialFont.afm and
    VerySpecialFont.pfa (.pfb).

8.) Can png2swf handle transparency?

    It supports PNG mode 2 transparency (256 color palettes with alpha) since version 0.4.2. 
    Mode 6 (32 bit RGBA truecolor) is also supported since version 0.4.4.

9.) How to do Flash MX compression with SWFTools?

    Most tools support the -z flag for outputting compressed SWF.
    Furthermore you can compress/uncompress SWF files using swfcombine:

	swfcombine -dz file.swf -o file_new.swf

    compresses, while

	swfcombine -d file.swf -o file_new.swf

    decompresses.

10.) avi2swf converts my avi files upside down!

    Try using the -p (--flip) switch.

11.) How to extract images/sounds from myfile.swf using swfextract?

    First list all extractable items:

	swfextract myfile.swf
    
    The result is something like:

	Objects in file myfile.swf:
	Shapes: 1, 2, 3
	MovieClips: 4, 5, 8, 10, 12
	JPEGs: 69, 116, 447
	PNGs: 318
	Sounds: 28, 29, 30
	Frames: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

    Not you can extract a shape using

	swfextract -i 2 myfile.swf -o shape.swf

    a sound using
	
	swfextract -s 28 myfile.swf -o sound.wav

    a PNG image file using
	
	swfextract -p 318 myfile.swf -o file.png

    etc.

12.) Is there a mailing list for SWFTools?

    Yes there is. You can subscribe by going to
