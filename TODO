swfc:

    * .replace command
    * output filename (name.sc -> name.swf)
    * .hide/.show?
    * .rotate
    * store instance coordinates for .put with same name after .del?

pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
    * fix memory leaks
    * some bounding boxes are too big
    * support for ttf fonts in --fontdirs
    * upgrade ttf2pt1

font2swf:
    
    * implement support for truetype fonts.

swfcombine:

    * Handle Bounding boxes
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff, too?
    * allow "combining" Actionscript and SWF.
    * "swfcombine -m" (e.g. "swfcombine -mT test.swf") duplicates depths:
	relocate depth in normalcombine()
    * "swfcombine -mT file.swf -x 300 file2.swf" doesn't work

swfextract:
    
    * mp3 extraction should also work for movieclips.

wav2swf:
    
    * -r flag doesn't work without -d option.

librfxswf:

    * Actionscript has memory leaks
    * Font routines still need a little more work (shape alignment)

other:

    * swfcrop
    * swf2fig
