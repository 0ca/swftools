General:

    * make more stuff dependent on the information in config.h
    * consistent output handling if -o is missing. (out.swf/stdout)

pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
    * fix memory leaks
    * some bounding boxes are too big
    * allow additional fontdirectories to be specified?
    * implement -q (--quiet) option, especially for -b and -l

swfcombine:

    * Handle Bounding boxes
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff, too?
    * allow "combining" Actionscript and SWF.

swfextract:
    
    * mp3 extraction should also work for movieclips and definesound.
    * improve placeobject handling

rfxswf-lib:
   
    * swf_WriteFont() should write definefont2 tags for more complex fonts
    * modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0
    * modules/swffont:TextSetInfoRecord doesn't allow changing to coordinate 0
    * (s/GetFrameNo/GetTagFrameNo/g ?)
