Priorities:
1. Do some sample swfs for swfcombine 
2. Make pdf2swf cope with more complex pdfs
3. General improvements
4. Cleanups in rfxswf-lib.

Make pdf2swf cope with more complex pdfs:

    The following pdf properties are not yet dealt with:
    * Links
    * lossless image file formats
    * dashed lines
    * (type 3 and truetype fonts)

Do some sample swfs for swfcombine:

    * Some swf for displaying other swfs frame by frame (e.g. with next/previous
      buttons) would be very handy for swfs generated by pdf2swf

General Improvements:

    * temporary file name generation is broken: pdf2swf/pdf2swf.cc, pdf2swf/xpdf/gfile.cc
    * fix memory leaks
    * rfxswf: modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0

Cleanups in rfxswf-lib:
    
    * LPTAGs etc. should be TAG*s
    * function names should have a prefix (rfxswf_ or swflib_ or sth.)
    * GetMatrix should be named GetMATRIX, as it gets a MATRIX datatype. Same for CXFORM etc.
    * element names should be lowercase
    * DataPos should be named DataReadPos, DataSize DataWritePos.
