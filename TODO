Priorities:
1. Make the swfs that pdf2swf generates smaller
2. General improvements
3. Make pdf2swf cope with more complex pdfs
4. Do some sample swfs for swfcombine 
5. Cleanups in rfxswf-lib.

Make the swfs pdf2swf generates smaller:

    * At the moment, the output of pdf2swf is a bunch of
      polygons. Try using seperate shapes for each character,
      and packing all shapes of a page in a font. 

Make pdf2swf cope with more complex pdfs:

    The following pdf properties are not yet dealt with:
    * Links
    * lossless image file formats
    * dashed lines
    * (type 3 and truetype fonts)
    Bugs:
    * big jpegs sometimes have wrong colors

Do some sample swfs for swfcombine:

    * Some swf for displaying other swfs frame by frame (e.g. with next/previous
      buttons) would be very handy for swfs generated by pdf2swf

General Improvements:

    * temporary file name generation is broken: pdf2swf/pdf2swf.cc, pdf2swf/xpdf/gfile.cc
    * fix memory leaks
    * rfxswf: modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0
    * write manpages for swfstrings and swfdump
    * --version should work in all tools.

Cleanups in rfxswf-lib:
    
    * LPTAGs etc. should be TAG*s
    * function names should have a prefix (rfxswf_ or swflib_ or sth.)
    * GetMatrix should be named GetMATRIX, as it gets a MATRIX datatype. Same for CXFORM etc.
