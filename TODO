pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
    * fix memory leaks
    * some bounding boxes are too big
    * support for ttf fonts in --fontdirs

swfcombine:

    * Handle Bounding boxes
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff, too?
    * allow "combining" Actionscript and SWF.
    * "swfcombine -m" (e.g. "swfcombine -mT test.swf") duplicates depths:
	relocate depth in normalcombine()

swfextract:
    
    * mp3 extraction should also work for movieclips.
    * improve placeobject handling

wav2swf:
    
    * -r flag doesn't work without -d option.
