General:

    * make more stuff dependent on the information in config.h
    * consistent output handling if -o is missing. (out.swf/stdout)

pdf2swf:

    * The following pdf properties are not yet dealt with:
      o Links
      o dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
      o (type 3 and truetype fonts)
    * write DEFINE_FONTINFO-Tags to give results for swfstrings 
      (suppress them as option)
    * temporary file name generation is broken: pdf2swf/pdf2swf.cc, pdf2swf/xpdf/gfile.cc
    * fix memory leaks

swfcombine:

    * Allow substituting frames (which have a name), too?
    * Allow ids instead of names
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff

rfxswf-lib:
    
    * modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0
    * function names should have a prefix (rfxswf_ or swflib_ or sth.)
    * element names should be lowercase
    * DataPos should be named DataReadPos, DataSize DataWritePos.
    * bitcount should be named BitWritePos, bitmask BitReadPos
