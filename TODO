General:

    * make more stuff dependent on the information in config.h
    * consistent output handling if -o is missing. (out.swf/stdout)
    * check for WORDS_BIGENDIAN in all routines handling SWF data.

pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
    * fix memory leaks
    * some bounding boxes are too big
    * allow additional fontdirectories to be specified?
    * implement -q (--quiet) option, especially for -b and -l

swfcombine:

    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff, too?

swfextract:
    
    * add support for extraction of bitmaps and sounds into 'native' formats (mp3, jpg, png)
    * improve placeobject handling

swfdump:

    * Make the output shorter.

rfxswf-lib:
   
    * swf_WriteFont() should write definefont2 tags for more complex fonts
    * modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0
    * modules/swffont:TextSetInfoRecord doesn't allow changing to coordinate 0
    * (s/GetFrameNo/GetTagFrameNo/g ?)
