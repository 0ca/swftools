Priorities:
1. Do some sample swfs for swfcombine 
2. Make pdf2swf cope with more complex pdfs
3. General improvements, Autoconf
4. Cleanups in rfxswf-lib.

Make pdf2swf cope with more complex pdfs:

    The following pdf properties are not yet dealt with:
    * Links
    * lossless image file formats
    * dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small)
    * (type 3 and truetype fonts)
    * write DEFINE_FONTINFO-Tags to give results for swfstrings 
      (suppress them as option)

Do some sample swfs for swfcombine:

    * Some swf for displaying other swfs frame by frame (e.g. with next/previous
      buttons) would be very handy for swfs generated by pdf2swf

General Improvements:

    * temporary file name generation is broken: pdf2swf/pdf2swf.cc, pdf2swf/xpdf/gfile.cc
    * fix memory leaks
    * rfxswf: modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0
    * consistent output handling if -o is missing. (out.swf/stdout)
    * swfcombine: Allow substituting frames (which have a name), too?

Cleanups in rfxswf-lib:
    
    * LPTAGs etc. should be TAG*s
    * function names should have a prefix (rfxswf_ or swflib_ or sth.)
    * element names should be lowercase
    * DataPos should be named DataReadPos, DataSize DataWritePos.
    * bitcount should be named BitWritePos, bitmask BitReadPos
  
Autoconf:
    * Disabling of jpeg2swf (if libjpeg isn't there) doesn't work yet
