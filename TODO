General:

    * make more stuff dependent on the information in config.h

pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
    * fix memory leaks
    * some bounding boxes are too big
    * support for ttf fonts in --fontdirs
    * antialize ImageMasks.

png2swf:

    * handle bit packing
    * handle splitted IDAT chunks etc.

swfcombine:

    * Handle Bounding boxes
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff, too?
    * allow "combining" Actionscript and SWF.

swfextract:
    
    * mp3 extraction should also work for movieclips and definesound.
    * improve placeobject handling

lib/examples:

    * make an example for edittext fields

rfxswf-lib:
   
    * modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0
    * modules/swffont:TextSetInfoRecord doesn't allow changing to coordinate 0
    * getUsedIDs doesn't work for bitmap fill
    * parsing of DefineFont2 has bugs.
