swfc:

    * simple actionscript commands
    * rewrite in python
    * python plugins?
    * .texture
    * .lock/.unlock
    * object rel coords, as in obj1.(x,y) and monkey.nose
	"follow me" feature:  default, or should it be explicitly specified?
    * .replace command
	.crossfade command????
    * .soundstream
    * text:  newlines
    * .egon  (stub is there, never really implemented)... folding edges?
    * .editbox
    * .buttons
    * .importassets
    * default output filename (name.sc -> name.swf) if unspecified
    * .hide/.show?
    * .orbit
    * store instance coordinates for .put with same name after .del?
    * macros?  looping?  ways of reducing repetitive coding (and the length of sc files)?

pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
    * several bounding boxes are too big
    * support for ttf fonts in --fontdirs
    * add support for FreeType

font2swf:
    
    * implement support for truetype fonts.

avi2swf:

    * update manpage
    * speed up h.263 routines (MMX?)

swfcombine:

    * Handle Bounding boxes
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff, too?
    * allow "combining" Actionscript and SWF.
    * "swfcombine -m" (e.g. "swfcombine -mT test.swf") duplicates depths:
	relocate depth in normalcombine()
    * "swfcombine -mT file.swf -x 300 file2.swf" doesn't work
    * "swfcombine file.swf -s 200 box1=file1.swf" doesn't work if file1.swf contains sprites
    * "swfcombine file.swf -x 200 -y 200 -s 200 box1=file1.swf" doesn't work?
    * support for centering (remove need to set -x,-y parameters manually when linking
      preloaders)

swfextract:
    
    * mp3 extraction should also work for movieclips.

swfbbox:

    * add manpage
    * support for text boxes

wav2swf:

    * pad blocks for mp3 compression

librfxswf:

    * Actionscript has memory leaks
    * Font routines still need a little more work (shape alignment)

png2swf:

    * Image mode 4
    * Interlace mode 1

Makefiles/configure/installation:

    * check for vsnprintf, strndup etc. and supply replacements

other:

    * swf2fig
    * swfrender

documentation:

    * basic command set 
    * example set illustrating basics
    * cook book:  how to get familiar effects 
	(fade/wipe/titles/scrolling/false perspective etc)
    * complete list of all required packages and libs and how to get/build them
