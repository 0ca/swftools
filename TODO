General:

    * make more stuff dependent on the information in config.h
    * consistent output handling if -o is missing. (out.swf/stdout)

pdf2swf:

    * The following pdf properties are not yet dealt with:
      o dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
      o (type 3 and truetype fonts)
    * temporary file name generation is broken: pdf2swf/pdf2swf.cc, pdf2swf/xpdf/gfile.cc
    * fix memory leaks

swfcombine:

    * Allow substituting frames (which have a name), too?
    * Allow ids instead of names
    * --cat option (concatenates the movies)?
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff
    * --merge mode? (Doesn't store everything in movieclips)

swfdump:

    * Make the output shorter.

rfxswf-lib:
   
    * swf_WriteFont() should write definefont2 tags for more complex fonts,
      example textfields don't show characters >256.
    * modules/swfshape doesn't allow changing to fillstyle 0
    * modules/swffont:TextSetInfoRecord doesn't allow changing to coordinate 0
    * s/GetDataSize/GetTagLen/g
      s/GetDataSizePtr/GetTagLenPtr/g
      s/ObjectPlace/ObjectSet/g
      (s/GetFrameNo/GetTagFrameNo/g ?)
    * swfshape.c: the shape parameter is mostly unused. so are px, py.
    * swf_SetBits() crashes if the tag has no data allocated yet.
