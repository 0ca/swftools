swfc:

    * .texture
    * object rel coords, as in obj1.(x,y) and monkey.nose
	"follow me" feature:  default, or should it be explicitly specified?
    * .replace command
	.crossfade command????
    * .sound file.wav ?  
	syntax for single sound hits, looping, synch sound stream.
    * text:  newlines
    * dump format for ingestion into swifty?
    * .editbox
    * default output filename (name.sc -> name.swf) if unspecified
    * change .swf to .flash ?  
	import swfs with .swf instead of .movie?
    * more colour names?  X11 colour names?  (we are Linux after all...)
    * .hide/.show?
    * .orbit
    * store instance coordinates for .put with same name after .del?
    * macros?  looping?  ways of reducing repetitive coding (and the length of sc files)?

pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)
    * fix memory leaks
    * some bounding boxes are too big
    * support for ttf fonts in --fontdirs
    * upgrade ttf2pt1

font2swf:
    
    * implement support for truetype fonts.  [yes please :-)]

swfcombine:

    * Handle Bounding boxes
    * Relocate  SetTarget "/content"  stuff, too?
    * allow "combining" Actionscript and SWF.
    * "swfcombine -m" (e.g. "swfcombine -mT test.swf") duplicates depths:
	relocate depth in normalcombine()
    * "swfcombine -mT file.swf -x 300 file2.swf" doesn't work

swfextract:
    
    * mp3 extraction should also work for movieclips.

wav2swf:
    
    * -r flag doesn't work without -d option.

librfxswf:

    * Actionscript has memory leaks
    * Font routines still need a little more work (shape alignment)

other:

    * swfcrop
    * swf2fig

documentation:

    * basic command set 
    * example set illustrating basics
    * cook book:  how to get familiar effects 
	(fade/wipe/titles/scrolling/false perspective etc)
    * complete list of all required packages and libs and how to get/build them
