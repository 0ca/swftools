    * .morph
    * .soundstream
    * text: newlines
    * .texture
    * .orbit
    * plugins?
    * .lock/.unlock
    * object rel coords, as in obj1.(x,y) and monkey.nose
	"follow me" feature:  default, or should it be explicitly specified?
    * .replace command
	.crossfade command?
    * .egon  (stub is there, never really implemented)... folding edges?
    * .importassets
    * default output filename (name.sc -> name.swf) if unspecified
    * SWF 3 actionscript commands shortcuts: geturl, gotoframe?
    * .hide/.show?
    * store instance coordinates for .put with same name after .del?
    * macros?  looping?  ways of reducing repetitive coding (and the length of sc files)?

pdf2swf:

    * Implement dashed lines (maybe by using fillstyle to keep Shapes small, maybe
	      optional- use another color for dashed lines)

avi2swf:

    * speed up h.263 routines (MMX?)
    * support for all-black I-Frames
    * do a flash player test suite to find out which h.263 movies work where

swfcombine:

    * "swfcombine -mT file.swf -x 300 file2.swf" doesn't work
    * "swfcombine file.swf -s 200 box1=file1.swf" doesn't work if file1.swf contains sprites
    * "swfcombine file.swf -x 200 -y 200 -s 200 box1=file1.swf" doesn't work?
    * swfcombine -f should allocate a proper depth, not just use 65535.
    * Handle Bounding boxes
    * support for centering (remove need to set -x,-y parameters manually when linking
      preloaders)
    * fix clipdepths

swfextract:
    
    * mp3 extraction should also work for movieclips.
    * frame extraction should also extract not yet deleted characters from the previous frames.

swfbbox:

    * support for MorphShape?
    * support for clipping when doing -e.

wav2swf:

    * pad blocks for mp3 compression
    * stereo support?

librfxswf:

    * logging
    * fix font parsing- code offsets should be used
    * add automatical size optimization by re-using tags with identical data

png2swf:

    * Image mode 4
    * Interlace mode 1
    * filtering: is alpha 255 or 0 in non-existant surrounding pixels?

swfrender:

    * Does a move-type PLACEOBJECT2 reset matrix etc. if it isn't set?
    * If an actionscript in frame 2 sets a sprite (set in frame 1) to frame 3, what
      does happen if we jump to frame 3 directly?

Makefiles/configure/installation:

    * check for vsnprintf, bcopy, bzero, strndup etc. and supply replacements

other:

    * swf2fig
    * swfrender
    * update man pages

documentation:

    * basic command set 
    * example set illustrating basics
    * cook book:  how to get familiar effects 
	(fade/wipe/titles/scrolling/false perspective etc)
    * complete list of all required packages and libs and how to get/build them
