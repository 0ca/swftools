Creating browseable SWFs from PDFs

   Suppose you have an arbitrary pdf file, "document.pdf". Furthermore,
   you have downloaded [1]SimpleViewer.swf into the directory where
   document.pdf lies.
   Now call:
   $ pdf2swf -o tmp.swf document.pdf
   $ swfcombine -o flashfile.swf SimpleViewer.swf viewport=tmp.swf 
   Now, flashfile.swf should be a browseable flash representation of
   document.pdf which can be embedded into your web page.
   If you don't know how to embed SWFs into html pages, it's explained at
   [2]http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/ts/documents/tn4150.html .
   
Creating JPEG Slideshows

   You can do the same thing described above with jpeg files. Simply use
   $ jpeg2swf -o tmp.swf pic1.jpeg pic2.jpeg ...
   $ swfcombine -o flashfile.swf SimpleViewer.swf viewport=tmp.swf 
   
Linking a Preloader

   Depending on the size of your PDFs/SWFs, you may want to have some
   kind of loading animation displayed while the browser is busy getting
   the actual document. Assuming you have some file like flashfile.swf
   above, you furthermore need the file [3]PreLoader.swf and an arbirtary
   loading animation of your choice. (To get started, try [4]loading.swf,
   or just convert a "Loading" JPEG picture to swf (jpeg2swf -o
   loading.swf picture.jpg)) Now use
   $ swfcombine -o flashfilewithloader.swf PreLoader.swf
   loader=loading.swf movie=flashfile.swf 
   
Creating your own Viewers

   If you know about Flash, and you want to substitute SimpleViewer from
   above with something more sophisticated, follow these rules:
   1. There has to be some rectangle (Movieclip, whatever... ) in your
   Viewer, named "viewport". (This name is used to reference the object
   when using swfcombine for merging it with the converted pdfs)
   2. Browsing buttons next to the rectangle (which turn pages in the
   shown pdf) should trigger some Actionsscript events, like
   
     SetTarget "viewport"
     NextFrame
     SetTarget ""
     
   to set the frame in the to-be-replaced rectangle. (It will be replaced
   with a MovieClip, therefore a SetTarget is neccessary)
