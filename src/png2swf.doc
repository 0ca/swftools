Usage: %s [-X width] [-Y height] [-o file.swf] [-r rate] file1.png [file2.png...]

Takes a number of png files and converts them to a swf movie, one
picture per frame.

This tools converts png image files into an SWF animation. It takes any
number of input pictures, and converts them to SWF one-by-one, where every
converted picture is a seperate frame in the target SWF. 
.PP
The way the
images are encoded in SWF is very similar to PNG (in that a zlib-based, lossless
compression algorithm is used). Under special circumstances, when the image
is 32 bpp with alpha information, it is converted to (lossy) jpeg compression
though, to preserve the alpha, which can't be encoded in any other way in the SWF.

-r, --rate <framerate>
    Set movie framerate (frames per second)
-o, --output <filename>
    Set name for SWF output file.
    Explicitly specify output file. (Otherwise, output will go to stdout / output.swf)
-X, --pixel <width>
    Force movie width to <width> (default: autodetect)
-Y, --pixel <height>
    Force movie height to <height> (default: autodetect)
-v, --verbose <level>
    Set verbose level (0=quiet, 1=default, 2=debug)
-C, --cgi
    For use as CGI- prepend http header, write to stdout
-V, --version
    Print version information and exit
